# VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENT

## Introduction:
This  Practical Assignment emphasizes the application of version control concepts in the development and evaluation of machine learning models. The assignment is designed to enhance students’ practical understanding of collaborative software development, effective use of Git and GitHub workflows, and systematic model evaluation techniques.

Through this project, students will demonstrate their ability to clone, run, modify, and manage machine learning code using a version control system. The assignment also introduces learners to the key differences between centralized/local and distributed version control systems, enabling them to appreciate modern collaborative development practices.

Additionally, students will implement and compare multiple machine learning models using a common dataset, evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics, and present their findings through clear documentation. This practical exercise builds essential skills in teamwork, version control, experimentation, and technical reporting, preparing students for real-world software development and data science projects.

This project aims to compare 9 popular machine learning classifiers and 7 regressors type machine learning models and measure their performance against neural network models to find out which machine learning model performs better. Since the dataset used is related to supply chain important parameters are identified and the machine learning models are trained with the dataset for detection of fraud transactions, late delivery of orders, sales revenue and quantity of products which customer orders. The machine learning classifiers used in this project are Logistic Regression,Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, k - Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest classification, Extra Trees classification,Extreme Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree classification for fraud detection and to predict late delivery on the basis accuracy,recall score and F1 score. The regression models used are Lasso, Ridge, Light Gradient boosting, Random Forest regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Linear Regression to predict sales and quantity of the products required which are compared with mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squareerror (RMSE).

## Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is maintained transparently with the Creative Commons 4.0 license by Fabian Constante, Fernando Silva,and António Pereira through the Mendeley data repository. The dataset consists of roughly 180k transactions from supply chains used by the company DataCo Global for 3 years. The dataset can be downloaded from:
